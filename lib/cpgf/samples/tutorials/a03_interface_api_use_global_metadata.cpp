	// Now let's see how to use interface based API.
	//
	// The APIs we used in tutorial a01 and a02, such as GMetaClass, GMetaField, etc, are class and function based API.
	// They are normal native C++ classes and functions.
	// The problem of the classes and functions, they are not binary compatible across dynamic libraries and compilers.
	// It's not easy, or even not possible, to use classes in another dynamic library compiled by another compiler.
	//
	// That's why interface based API was developed.
	// All interface based APIs are using interface. Or to say, Windows COM (Component Object Model) style interfaces.
	// All interfaces have similar name with their class counterpart. IMetaClass is the interface for GMetaClass, etc.
	//
	// Important reminding, interface based APIs are NOT optional.
	// These kind of APIs are the most important APIs in cpgf library.
	// Also, the serialization and script binding libraries, are developed upon interface based APIs.
	//
	// Now let's start using interface based API.
	// First let's get an instance of IMetaService.
	// IMetaService is a center to obtain all meta data in the system.
	// We call createDefaultMetaService() to get a service to represent the global meta repository.
	// NOTE: All interface instance returned by cpgf must be freed (releaseReference) by the caller.
	// The simplest way to do it is to use GScopedInterface to hold the instance.
	GScopedInterface<IMetaService> service(createDefaultMetaService());

	GScopedInterface<IMetaMethod> method;
	GScopedInterface<IMetaField> field;
	GVariant value;

	// Get the global meta class to use the function "greeting".
	// The service returned by createDefaultMetaService will only hold one module to represent current program.
	// The meta service is designed to work on multiple dynamic libraries.
	// A dynamic library (include the program itself), is called a module.
	// Each module has only one meta repository.
	// Please bear in mind, cpgf was not tested in cross dynamic library environment yet, so the service/module
	// architecture may not be matured.
	GScopedInterface<IMetaModule> globalModule(service->getModuleAt(0));
	GScopedInterface<IMetaClass> globalMetaClass(globalModule->getGlobalMetaClass());
	method.reset(globalMetaClass->getMethod("greeting"));
	metaInvokeMethod(method.get(), NULL, "world");

	GScopedInterface<IMetaClass> pointMetaClass(service->findClassByName("Point"));

	Point point(5, 8);

	field.reset(pointMetaClass->getField("x"));
	// Here we get value from the field.
	// Unlike the class and function based API which passes GVariant and GMetaType around,
	// The interface based API uses GVariantData and GMetaTypeData to gain the binary compatibility.
	// Fortunately, in the header gmetaapiutil.h, there are a bunch of utility functions to hide the conversion
	// between GVariant and GVariantData, GMetaType and GMetaTypeData.
	value = metaGetValue(field.get(), &point);
	cout << "point.x is " << fromVariant<int>(value) << " (should be 5)" << endl;

	method.reset(pointMetaClass->getMethod("extend"));
	// Another handy utility function to invoke the method.
	metaInvokeMethod(method.get(), &point, 2);
	cout << "After extend, point.x is " << fromVariant<int>(metaGetValue(field.get(), &point)) << " (should be 10)" << endl;


	method.reset(pointMetaClass->getMethod("getArea"));
	value = metaInvokeMethod(method.get(), &point);
	cout << "The area is " << fromVariant<int>(value) << " (should be 160)" << endl;

	Point * p;

	p = static_cast<Point *>(pointMetaClass->createInstance());
	cout << "createInstance -- point.x is " << p->x << " (should be 0)" << endl;
	pointMetaClass->destroyInstance(p);

	GScopedInterface<IMetaConstructor> constructor(pointMetaClass->getConstructorAt(0));
	p = static_cast<Point *>(metaInvokeConstructor(constructor.get(), 3, 8));
	cout << "constructor -- point.x is " << p->x << " (should be 3)" << endl;
	pointMetaClass->destroyInstance(p);
